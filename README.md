Camunda Platform 8 with Spring Boot Demo
---

This project aims at showcasing how the following technologies and architectural principles can be used together in
an example application.

Here is a link to [an article on Medium](https://medium.com/@gushakov/af8733ec0024) which references this repository.

- Camunda Platform 8 (self-managed)
- BPMN workflow
- Spring Boot
- Clean Architecture
- DDD

## How to run

- Start the stack with `docker-compose up -d`
- Deploy BPMN diagram `bpmn/trip-flow.bpmn` to Camunda using Simple Monitor interface
- Run Spring Boot application (default profile) from the IDE

## What is running

- TripFlow applicaiton: http://localhost:8080/trip (username: `customer1` or `customer2`, password: `demo`)
- Camunda Self-Managed instance (with Hazelcast exporter): localhost, ports: 26500 (and others)
- Zeebe Simple Monitor: http://localhost:8082/
- Postgres database: localhost, port 5432, database: `tripflow`

**Special thanks** to Camunda team who gave me some pointers about how to integrate Zeebe's Java client. [This GitHub
repo](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-8-lowcode-ui-template) was especially helpful.

:star: As I am writing this, [CamundaCon 2022](https://www.camundacon.com/) is taking place! There is a great
presentation by Luc Weinbrecht, speaking exactly about how to use Camunda and Clean Architecture together.
